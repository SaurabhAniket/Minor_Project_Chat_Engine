# Minor_Project_Chat_Engine
A chat app is a software application designed to facilitate real-time communication between users through text messages. It allows individuals or groups to engage in conversations, share information, and express thoughts and ideas in a chat-based format. Chat apps have become increasingly popular in recent years due to their convenience.

STEP 1: Homepage This is our homepage where you can see two options in the top right corner. The first option is "Login" and the second option is "Chat". If you click on the "Chat" option without creating an account on the app it will redirect you to the Sign-up page. 
STEP 2: SignUp Page School of Computer Engineering, KIIT, BBSR 7
CHAT ENGINE Now, you are on the create account page where you have to provide us with your basic information like name, email, and password. This information will eventually be saved in our database. We also require you to upload a profile picture. 
STEP 3: Login Page Once you have created your account, you can now login to our website using your email address and password. 
STEP 4: On the left side, you can see the available chat rooms where you can join and start talking to other users. You can also see who is currently online by looking at the list of members at the bottom of the page. If you want to have a private conversation, you can click on the person's name and start chatting with them personally
STEP 5 - On the left side, you can see the available chat rooms where you can join and start talking to other users. You can also see who is currently online by looking at the list of members at the bottom of the page. If you want to have a private conversation, you can click on the person's name and start chatting with them personally. STEP 5: FIG 4.5 Chatting Area This is the main chat page where all public conversations take place. You can see that I sent the message "hi" at 18:41 and ayushmaan and Sumit replied back. One of the features we have added is similar to Telegram's chat feature where new users can see previous messages even if they join the chat late. We think this is a great idea because new users can catch up on important messages they may have missed when they were not present in the group chat.
